# coding_interview

Trying to get a wide variety of coding interview questions in Ruby and Java. 
These are not guaranteed to be error free or the most efficient solutions even though I try my best to make it in good shape. 

Feel free to raise PRs or Issues if you find any issues or better solutions.

There are still some incomplete problems and design questions mostly have only sample codes currently as I'm yet to look into them
