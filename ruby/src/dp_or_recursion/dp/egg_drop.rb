#n=2 eggs and a building with k=36 floors.
#Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a 36-story building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to break on landing
#An egg that survives a fall can be used again
#A broken egg must be discarded
#The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs
#If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor
#If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall

#What is the least number of egg-droppings that is guaranteed to work in all cases?

#Approach: DP

#Let k => Number of floors and n=> Number of eggs

#Since we need to minimize the number of trials in worst case, we take the maximum of two cases. We consider the max of above two cases for every floor and choose the floor which yields minimum number of trials

#1) If the egg breaks after dropping from xth floor, then we only need to check for floors lower than x with remaining eggs; so the problem reduces to x-1 floors and n-1 eggs
#2) If the egg doesnâ€™t break after dropping from the xth floor, then we only need to check for floors higher than x; so the problem reduces to k-x floors and n eggs.

#eggDrop(n, k) ==> Minimum number of trails needed to find the critical
#                    floor in worst case.
#  eggDrop(n, k) = 1 + min{max(eggDrop(n - 1, x - 1), eggDrop(n, k - x)): 
#                 x in {1, 2, ..., k}}

#This has overlapping sub problems which can be avoided by storing the min values in array[][]
